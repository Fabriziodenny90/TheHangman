# TheHangman
The Hangman game for Android. Multiplayer with Client-Server architecture.

Client_Hangman_Multyplayer is the NetBeans project to run the game on a Desktop machine. The game automatically connects to Room0 and there is no possibility to choose an arbitrary Room for playing yet.

Server_Hangman_Multiplayer is the NetBeans project to start the Server for the game. It presents only 10 rooms for joining matches. The default port is 4443. Use your machine's IP and this port from the Clients to connect to the server.

TheHangman folder contains the Android version of the game. You can open this project with Android Studio and install the game on an Android device.

The pdf contains various instructions on the code for this project.

I own the material in this repository. For any information you can contact me.

Cheers
